# Floral-Online-Flower-Shop
Flowers are indeed beautiful to see, there are people that finds flower as stress relievers. Looking at beautiful flowers or planting and growing them is kind of fun for them, but the problem is not all people have the time to plant it and grow flowers by themselves or don’t have the skills and knowledge to do so. Some don’t even have time to go to stores and look at the different kinds of flowers and buy it because it’s so much time consuming.  The team had come up of an idea of creating an application that will able the users to look at different kinds of flowers and make a purchase anytime and anywhere it saves so much time than going to an actual store and looking for what they want.  The Floral: Online Shop Application aims to provide customers with quality flowers, and floral arrangements at a decent price. Both of the seller and customer will benefit because of the efficiency and convenience that the application will provide. The tools that the team used are: Ionic framework, VS Code and Angular CLI.
